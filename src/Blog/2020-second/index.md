              to IoT’s
              cybersecurity problem. Built upon a fully developed and
              operable blockchain infrastructure, Emerald Circuit focuses on the physical collection of data using
              128-bit encryption, and patented IoT technology to both collect and transmit such secure data. Original
              side-chain networking provides data security and management as well as anti-tampering and
              anti-counterfeiting services. In the context of the Emerald Circuit sidechain and the Ambrosus
              blockchain, Emerald Circuit’s network begins when the smart container’s sensors collect data from the
              product environment. This data is immediately encrypted transmitted to the Emerald Circuit sidechain.
              Next, after creating proof of data security on the sidechain, the remaining data is pushed to a Hermes
              Masternode on the Ambrosus Network. The data is then condensed and hashed onto the larger Ambrosus
              blockchain.

            <p class="article-blog-content-text">
              Industrial revolutions are defined by huge jumps in productivity
              due to advances in mechanisation. The modern economy has benefited from three such revolutions so far;
              the invention of the steam engine in the late 18th century, the introduction of electricity and assembly
              lines in the 19th century, and the development of microchips and computers in the mid-to-late 20th
              century. Advances in smart technology will usher in a fourth industrial revolution, in which large-scale
              machine-to-machine communication (M2M) and IoT are integrated for increased automation and efficiency.
              “Industrie 4.0” companies will benefit from improved communication and self-monitoring via the
              production of smart machines that can analyze and diagnose issues without the need for human
              intervention.

              The 21st century will be one of smart machines at each level of
              production. The products of the future and the security processes involved in protecting them will be
              managed by integrated networks of smart devices that can securely relay information in real-time.
              Emerald Circuit’s network of secured smart devices is positioned to lead the charge into the fourth
              industrial revolution, and in doing so, usher in unprecedented opportunity for product security and
              reliable business connectivity.

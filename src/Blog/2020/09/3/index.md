            Emerald circuit is a rapidly developing sidechain ecosystem for the integration of IoT devices and intelligent objects. 
            Built on the Ambrosus Blockchain, Emerald Circuit offers full-circuit device security from sensor to cloud to blockchain 
            by providing its own sidechain network for anti-counterfeiting and security purposes. Put simply, Emerald Circuit offers 
            the hardware and software necessary to solve the garbage-in, garbage-out problem of blockchain data security. In context, 
            Emerald Circuit’s secure network of smart sensors provides a secure IoT-blockchain interface that will usher in novel business 
            opportunities in the industry 4.0 economy.
          </p>
          <p class="article-blog-content-text">
            The potential benefits of integrating IoT/blockchain networks are especially evident in the management of high value products, 
            the future of international logistics, as well as in supply and delivery chains: In all of such processes visibility into the 
            state of physical entities and trust among network participants are typically lacking. Integrated networks can provide customers 
            with guaranteed metrics on packaging dates, conditions of the shipping environment, and length of time spent in inventory. With 
            consumers increasingly focused on product <span class="article-blog-content-text-span"> quality over price </span>, businesses stand to benefit from the integrated network’s individualized certification.
          </p>
          <p class="article-blog-content-text">
            The only thing more important than traceability to an industry 4.0 company will be anti-counterfeiting and product security: 
            A <span class="article-blog-content-text-span"> recent </span> study by the Palo Alto Institute found that over 98% of IoT traffic is unencrypted, and therefore categorized as 
            ‘vulnerable’ to cyber security attacks. Emerald Circuit alleviates this concern with patented and networked IoT devices - 
            ranging from intelligent containers and boxes to smart flasks. Designed to be integrated with the products themselves, the 
            set of Emerald Circuit solutions are capable of monitoring a diverse parameter of environmental conditions while also providing 
            inbuilt anti-counterfeiting features. They all fit together in a secure and encrypted fashion, forming a network of connected 
            sensors that give business owners a total view of the surroundings of their products. Overall, such products are used to secure 
            individual assets, or for entire batches of assets that require real-time monitoring, status verification and anti-counterfeiting protection.

            Who Can Benefit?
          </h2>

          <p class="article-blog-content-text">
            A key value proposition for combined IoT and blockchain solutions is to enable smart contracts, which are used to help automate supply 
            chain processes and enforce commercial agreements on how products are handled from production to consumption. Consider the following case 
            of high-value artifacts that may be particularly vulnerable to tampering or damages:
            <span class="article-blog-content-text-span"> $10 trillion </span>
            US dollars.
          </p>
          <p class="article-blog-content-text">
            When an artifact is placed in a smart container, an intelligent object is used to read data in order to confirm that the product has been 
            safely packaged and closed. Using an embedded thermometer and shock and lighting detectors to flag any opening of the container or change 
            to its conditions, Emerald Circuit tracks the product from origin to delivery. All the while, the blockchain infrastructure is used to 
            capture all the data readings in a distributed ledger. When the smart contract learns from metadata stored on the IoT platform that a package 
            has arrived at a specific auction house or museum, it records the state of the package (including location, temperature upon arrival, 
            and tampering status) in the blockchain DLT.
          </p>
           <p class="article-blog-content-text">
            Ultimately, the primary value of Emerald Circuit’s network of smart container’s is found in the security and anti-tampering protection 
            it provides to high value or easily tampered with assets. Companies that implement Emerald Circuit technology will no longer require 
            security services to ensure safe passage for their products from point A to point B, since the artificially intelligent containers themselves 
            will be tamper-proof. The total revamping of product security increases trust among stakeholders and ensures the product’s safe arrival.

            The Future of Business: Secure Product Management
          </h3>
          <p class="article-blog-content-text">
            Blockchain and IoT combined are the future of industrial business applications. Together they provide a platform for offering secure, 
            data-based multiparty applications that can increase efficiencies, automate processes, and cut costs. Most importantly, closing the IoT 
            loophole increases trust in products and guarantees product security across environments - especially at a time when cybersecurity threats 
            and vulnerabilities are increasingly challenging business development and product security.

            In perspective, Emerald Circuit is a look into the future of autonomous systems and secure IoT for business, government, and logistics providers. 
            The prospect of self-validating, autonomous systems of interconnected production units is no longer confined to the realm of science fiction.
          </p>
          <p class="article-blog-content-text">
            Autonomous objects able to interpret real-time data and make their own decisions is tantamount to technological sentience. Emerald Circuit 
            pursuit of this objective is ultimately directed towards building future solutions for economy-wide artificial intelligence, finalizing the 
            human pursuit of automation, and ushering a new era of intelligent connectivity.

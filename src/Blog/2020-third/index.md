            Businesses around the world are in the midst of two technological innovations that must be brought
            together to
            realize their full potential: The first, the “Internet of Things,” (or IoT) revolution is changing
            our relationship to product distribution and business analytics as more and more products take on
            “smart” characteristics and enter into new networks of connectivity. IoT enables the monitoring and
            management
            of physical things to improve and support situational awareness and business process execution. The
            second,
            is blockchain, which provides businesses with immutable data management within their networks. Both of
            these developments promise to increase efficiency, cut redundancies, and provide company-wide
            connectivity
            like never before, all surrounding a new core commodity: Data.
          </p>
          <p class="article-blog-content-text">
            Historically, IoT devices and communication protocols have varied
            widely by production system in terms of
            both reliability and security. This poses a problem to the security of an otherwise secure blockchain
            network.
            Known as the ‘Garbage-in, Garbage-Out problem’ IoT devices threaten to delegitimize the security and
            immutability provided by blockchain networks: While blockchain’s security benefits are
            {' '}
            <span class="article-blog-content-text-span">well known</span>
            , the
            original data entry must be made in good faith to protect the integrity of the data that is stored and
            shared
            amongst parties. In other words, the security of a blockchain is only as solid as its input data.

            There are two concerns when it comes to IoT security. First, if bad
            actors wish, they can hijack IoT readers and scanners. This can be done via product spoofing in the form
            of
            ID
            replacement, encryption key replacement, and the retransmission of older intercepted data as well as
            through
            malicious and authorized attacks on devices (i.e. the modification of the time stamped data). From
            smartphones
            to smart homes, every IoT device has the potential to be hacked. Hackers who gain access to IoT will be
            able
            alter data, access other devices on the network, and potentially infect much larger networks with
            viruses
            and
            malware.

            In context, Cybersecurity is the greatest threat to IoT implementation.
            In 2019, cyberattacks on IoT devices
            {' '}
            <span class="article-blog-content-text-span">surged 300%</span>
            , totaling over 2.9 billion hacking events. These
            attacks
            can
            be attributed to the fact that over
            {' '}
            <span class="article-blog-content-text-span">98 percent</span>
            {' '}
            of IoT traffic is unencrypted, making over half of all
            IoT
            devices vulnerable to medium- to high-severity attacks. These security breaches represent a significant
            financial cost and legal threat to companies operating within data protection and security regulations
            (GDPR).
            Though most security breaches make it to the headlines in the form of embarrassing leaks to private
            data,
            hackers are already using IoT breaches to access and exploit
            {' '}
            <span class="article-blog-content-text-span">company-wide data systems</span>
            {' '}

            ends.
